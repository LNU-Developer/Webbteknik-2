      <h2>Some info about myself</h2>
      <p>Hi everyone, isn't it fantastic to make some progress? I've always had the interest of becoming a full-stack developer. This is one side of the coin. Have a long way to go.</p>
      <p>My name is Rickard Marjanovic, I'm 31 years &quot;old&quot; and living in Helsingborg. You can say I started off my adult life in a strange way.</p>
      <p>Not knowing what I wanted I ended up with finishing a degree in economics, and continued my career as a public accountant. Even became an authorized public accountant last year.</p>
      <p>Even though I'm not expecting anyone here to know that that is or means, I can tell you it's hard work. </p>
      <h2>My goals in life</h2>
      <p>The following are my current goals.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>To become a fullstack developer</li>
            <li>To fully automate my home</li>
            <li>To start my own company</li>
         </ul>

      <p>To quickly get me to the course page, I've added a link: <a href="http://medieteknik.lnu.se/1me321" target="_blank">1ME321</a></p>
      <p>I've also created a placeholder for a page that I'm suppose to create with some answers to some questions. Please see <a href="dold/webteknik1u1/u1page1.htm" target="_blank">A</a>. (you'll probably need a password to. Sorry cant give you that...).</p>
      <p>So I've developed some new skills. By using CSS I've created a nice style for my answers to a second set of questions. Please see <a href="dold/webteknik1u2/u2page1.htm" target="_blank">D</a>.</p>
